# Actionale

Actionale is a Minecraft Mod that replaces vanilla's keybinds system with a more sophisticated keymap/action system.
It is completely compatible with any modded vanilla keybinds (they will automatically transfer to Actionale's keymaps
and actions), and modders can optionally add support for Actionale.

- Q: How do you pronounce this mod's name?  
  A: It should be pronounced `action-ale`, but I wouldn't be angry if you choose whatever you want.
